## My key takeaways from this exercise
- I learned about the roles of HTML and CSS in designing a website. HTML is for creating the document itself, and CSS is for designing the created document.
- I learned that using external CSS is a really good way to make web development more clean and less confusing since it separates the styling from the content. I think it is also a way to enable collaboration among web developers since it enables them to have separate roles in the way that one focuses on the content of the web, while the other focuses on the appearance of the web.
