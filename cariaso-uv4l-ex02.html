              <p class="desc">This Python project is a terminal game named "Type the Pattern" wherein a random pattern of characters is generated, and the player has to memorize it before it disappears then type the exact pattern afterwards. The game will continue for as long as the player does not fail to give the correct pattern, and the generated pattern will also continue getting longer. The game will be over once the player fails, and the score will be shown at the end. There are three difficulties (easy, medium, hard), and the scoring system depends on the chosen difficulty. Players are free to play again until they decide to quit the game. The scores are then stored in a separate text file.</p>

              <p class="desc">This Java project is called "Flario". It is inspired by Super Mario and Flappy Bird, and the gameplay is a combination of these two. There is a generated map with a finish line, and there are obstacles that deal damage to the player and power-ups along the way. The goal of the player is to overcome the obstacles and reach the finish line before the time runs out without dying.</p>

The user can use this app to solve problems regarding polynomial regression and quadratic spline interpolation. The user provides .csv files of x and y values and other numerical values as the input. It also serves as a diet problem solver wherein the user will choose food items, and from those, the program will provide the cheapest meal that satisfies some nutrient constraints.</p>
